# library_app

 Built this app using Flutter (Dart for front end and operation services) + Google's Firebase (Backend service) for an app where user can manage their own books that they have read.

Similar to Facebook, but this one have the added usage of adding books instead of adding photos. The creating user process is the same, and simpler.
